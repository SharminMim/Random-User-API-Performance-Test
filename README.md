# Random-User-API-Performance-Test-Using Jmeter
Load Testing and Stress Testing performed by using Jmeter with some scenarios on Random User API. Based on the given scenario,I have generated a jmeter html report and given screenshot of the report.

## Tools Used
- ```Jmeter```

## Test Scenarios Covered
Find out the actual TPS for if 120000 users can give load for 12 hours
Perform load test on this URL: Server: https://demoqa.com/BookStore/v1/Books
- Find out if the expected TPS (Transaction Per/Second) meet the above requirement. Breakdown the expected TPS in excel sheet and find out the actual TPS (10)
- Create another excel sheet where you will try to find out the bottleneck/stress test point. (At which point the system starts to show 1% error) (10)
- Also, in the excel find out the capacity value and mention beside the value that it is capacity TPS (5)
